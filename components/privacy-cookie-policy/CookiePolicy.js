                    A cookie is a small text file or a piece of information that

                    visit a website or use a mobile app. Almost every website
                    uses cookie technology. Cookies serve a number of purposes
                    such as letting you navigate between webpages efficiently,
                    remembering your preferences, and generally improving the
                    user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether
                    you have visited our Website before or whether you are a new
                    visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see
                    online are more relevant to you and your interests. This
                    functionality makes cookies extremely useful to improve your
                    user experience when you return to a website you have
                    already visited or use a mobile app.
