                  On some pages of the HUBX sites, third parties that provide
                  content, applications or plug-ins through the HUBX sites may
                  track your use of content, applications and plug-ins or
                  customize content, applications and plug-ins for you. For
                  example, when you click to access our page on social media
                  site by clicking on the button (e.g., LinkedIn or Twitter),
                  the social network that has created the button may record that
                  you have done this. For more information on social media
                  plug-ins on the HUBX sites, see the Cookie Policy.

                  Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the
                  Internet to collect and process personal information
                  necessarily involves the transmission of information on an
                  international basis. While we generally store all of the
                  personal information that we collect about you through the
                  HUBX sites in your region (for example for European visitors,
                  in the European Economic Area), it is possible that your
                  personal information will be transmitted to parties outside
                  your region (where data protection laws may be different). If
                  such transfer happens, we ensure that it takes place in
                  compliance with contractual or other measures to protect the
                  information.
