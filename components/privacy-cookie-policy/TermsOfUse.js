          <p>9.1</p>
          <p>
            A conflict of interest may arise where either of us, or any of our
            employees, directors, service providers or any person linked by
            control to either of us is providing a service to end users of the
            Platform, or engaging in activities on their own account, which may
            entail a material risk of damage to any end users of the Platform's
            interests, for example where either of us:
          </p>
          <p>
            (a) could make a financial gain, or avoid a financial loss, at the
            expense of an end user of the Platform;
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) has an interest in the outcome of a service provided to an end
            user of the Platform or of a transaction carried out an behalf of
            that person, which is distinct from that person's interest in that
            outcome;
          </p>
          <p>
            (c) has a financial or other incentive to favour the interest of one
            end user of the Platform, or group of end users of the Platform,
            over the interests of another end user of the Platform; or
          </p>
          <p>
            (d) receives or will receive from a person other than the end user
            of the Platform, an inducement in relation to a service provided to
            the end user of the Platform, in the form of monies, goods or
            services, other than the standard commission or fee for that
            service.
          </p>
          <p>
            (e) Because of the nature of the Platform, we may be regarded as
            providing services to all end users of the Platform and we will
            charge fees for such services as specified in each agreement we
            enter into with each end user of the Platform. We may also share
            payments received or make payments to third parties for introducing
            end users of the Platform to us. We will make appropriate disclosure
            of such arrangements in the rules applicable to any related
            promotions or otherwise on request.
          </p>
          <p>9.2</p>
          <p>
            We shall use all reasonable efforts to manage any conflict of
            interest. If we believe there is still a significant risk of damage
            to end users of the Platform we will consider appropriate
            disclosure.
          </p>
          <p>9.3</p>
          <p>
            We will maintain appropriate policies and procedures as well as
            training to ensure employees identify circumstances which give rise
            to a potential conflict of interest and to enable them to manage
            such conflicts and we will monitor conflicts which arise.
          </p>
          <p>9.4</p>
          <p>
            We will review and update our policy on conflicts of interest as
            necessary. Questions regarding our policy on conflicts of interest
            should be emailed to team@hubx.capital.
